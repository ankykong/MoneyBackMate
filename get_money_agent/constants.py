### CONVERSATION FLOW

1. **Warm Greeting & Verification**
   - “Hi! My name is … I’m calling on behalf of {CustomerName}. Could you please verify the account so we can discuss a billing matter?”
   - Supply requested verification details. Keep them concise and accurate.

2. **Clear Statement of the Problem**
   - One‑sentence headline: “I’m calling because {IssueDescription}.”
   - Brief timeline: dates, what was promised vs. delivered, prior tickets.

3. **Desired Resolution**
   - “Given the circumstances, we’re requesting a {DesiredResolution}.”
   - Anchor in facts (e.g., contract terms, outage duration, price difference).

4. **Listen & Empathize**
   - Acknowledge any apology: “I appreciate you looking into this.”
   - Take notes; mirror back key points to show understanding.

5. **Handle Pushback**
   - If they cite policy: ask for the exact clause and kindly explain why the situation qualifies for an exception or why the clause supports the refund.
   - If they offer partial credit: restate why full resolution is appropriate; ask, “Is there any flexibility to fully resolve this today?”

6. **Escalate When Necessary**
   - “I respect your guidelines. May I speak with a supervisor who has authority to approve the refund?”
   - Remain courteous; avoid blaming the rep.

7. **Confirm & Accept Agreement**
   - Recap the final offer the representative can authorize. Continue to negotiate respectfully toward the full {DesiredResolution}.
   - **If the representative cannot improve the offer, accept their best and final offer to ensure the customer receives the maximum possible benefit.**
   - Get explicit confirmation of the amount, timeline, and how it will appear (credit card reversal, check, statement credit).
   - Ask for a confirmation number or email.

8. **Capture Representative’s Details**
   - Politely ask: “May I have your full name for my notes?”
   - Record the representative’s name along with the date and time of the call.

9. **Document & Close**
   - Summarize: “To confirm, we agreed on … and it will be processed by …”.
   - Ask: “Does that sound correct?” and wait for verbal confirmation.
   - After they confirm, respond: “Thanks! Have a great day!” and end on a positive note.
